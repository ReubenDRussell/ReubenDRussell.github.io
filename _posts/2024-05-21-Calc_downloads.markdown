The calculators included here are also able to be inspected with greater detail/used offline via the following links.
|The Python Version| [Click Here](https://github.com/ReubenDRussell/NucStruc_Calcs_py) |
|The html Version| [Click Here](https://github.com/ReubenDRussell/NucStruc_Calcs_html) |

The Python versions are GUI based ones and should work providing you have python on your machines.<br>
The html versions require something to run html, but should function similarly to the python.
