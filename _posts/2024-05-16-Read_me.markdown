This is a test.<br>

The sources will be added in time. <br>

There are likely to be some rude words built in if an error is caused in the equation or similar. If this is not liked, you can take advantage of the offline versions and edit them out for your own use. <br>

Calculators and other parts of this are undergoing bug checking as of 16/05/24.<br>

The next thing I hope to add (following bug checking) is a search option. This will likely be based off one seen in the "minimal-mistakes-jekyll" theme.<br>

Maybe also add ORC-ID thing to the contact details and a few other bits etc.

I am aware that most people working in experimental nuclear will have their own versions of this; <br>if you do and want to use this: I'm flattered, <br>if you don't and have stumbled across this: help yourself, <br>if you are me and are reading this: WHY?!<br>
