I got bored and made a load of calculators for equations I have been using. May be useful for some other people too...<br>

| B(EL) &harr; M.E. & B(EL) unit conv. | B(EL) from matrix elements and unit conversions for B(EL) (inc. W.u.) | [Click Here](/Calculators/BEL_Calc) |
| Q<sub>s </sub> &harr; M.E. | Spectroscopic quadrupole moment from the matrix element of a state | [Click Here](/Calculators/Qs_Calc) |
| B(ML) &harr; M.E. & B(ML) unit conv. | B(ML) from matrix elements and unit conversions for B(ML) (inc. W.u.) | [Click Here](/Calculators/BML_Calc) |
| B(E2) &harr; &beta;<sub>2</sub> | For converting B(E2) to quadrupole deformation parameter (&beta;<sub>2</sub> ) | [Click Here](/Calculators/Beta-BE2_Calc) |
| B(E2) &harr; &#8739;Q<sub>s</sub>&#8739;<sub>rot lim</sub> | To find theoretical limit of Q<sub>s</sub> for an axial rotor | [Click Here](/Calculators/Qs_rot_lim_Calc) |
| Safe Coulex | Finding some limits for Coulomb excitation | [Click Here](/Calculators/Safe_Coulex) |


If I haven't got the calculator that you need, I am likely to have just not gotten around to it yet.<br>
